# CoreShop vs. eCommerce Framework

The idea behind CoreShop is totally different to the eCommerce framework. The eCommerce framework gives you skeleton for building
eCommerce applications and heavily depends on you doing all the things.

CoreShop, on the other hand, comes full-featured with a rich toolset of optional Components which you can use, or not use, for your
ecommerce Application. In other words: CoreShop is the framework on steroids :)

To be fair, both Systems have their purpose and you can do the same with both systems. The ecommerce Framework is designed
to be very good extendable but you still need to implement a lot of stuff yourself. CoreShop gives you a lot of out-of-the-box
features to quickly create rich ecommerce systems.
